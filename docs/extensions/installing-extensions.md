# Installing Extensions

Some extensions, particularly extensions that add language support, need to
compile the extension into a Wasm bundle. To do this, Gram uses Rust together
with the `wasm32-wasip2` target to build the Wasm extension on your local
machine.

You can either install these dependencies yourself, or alternatively if you have
[installed Rust via rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), Gram will
try to add the `wasm32-wasip2` target for you.

If you have installed Rust via a package manager but don't have the
`wasm32-wasip2` target installed, installing the extension will not work.

The editor will also need the WASI SDK in order to compile the extension and
tree-sitter grammar for language extensions. If the system-installed version of
`cargo` is able to compile to Wasm, the editor will only download the WASI
sysroot instead.

> **Note:** This is a core difference between Zed and Gram. Zed will download a
> precompiled Wasm bundle from the Zed website when installing an extension, to
> avoid having to build the extension locally.

You can search for extensions by launching the Gram Extension Gallery by
pressing {#kb gram::Extensions} , opening the command palette and selecting
{#action gram::Extensions} or by selecting "Gram > Extensions" from the menu
bar.

Here you can view the extensions that you currently have installed or search and
install new ones.

You can also install extensions for your local file system, or via a git URL.

## Installing Local Extensions

From the extensions page, click the `Install Local` button (or the {#action
gram::InstallExtensionFromFolder} action) and select the directory containing
your extension. You should see the extension begin to install in the status bar.

## Installing Extensions From A Git URL

From the extensions page, click the `Install From URL` button (or the {#action
gram::InstallExtensionFromUrl} action) and enter the git url for the extension.
You should see the extension begin to install in the status bar.

> **Note:** The editor must be able to authenticate the git URL, but does not
support SSH authentication. Using a public URL such as an `http(s)` git URL is
recommended. Check the logs to debug ({#action gram::OpenLog}).

## Installation Location

- On macOS, extensions are installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Gram/extensions`.
- On Linux, they are installed in either `$XDG_DATA_HOME/gram/extensions` or `~/.local/share/gram/extensions`.

This directory contains two subdirectories:

- `installed`, which contains the source code for each extension.
- `work` which contains files created by the extension itself, such as downloaded language servers.

## Removing extensions

Remove extensions from the Extensions interface.
